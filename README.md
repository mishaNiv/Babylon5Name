# Babylon5Name
This program takes user input and uses it to create a new name for the user, a name which is similar to the names in a popular culture show called Babylon 5. The program asks for the users first and last name, their favorite city, and the name of of one of their friends in order to forge their new Babylon 5 name. 

To run this program, it is recommended that Apache Netbeans is used, though similar IDEs may also work.
